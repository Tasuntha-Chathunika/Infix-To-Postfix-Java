# Infix-To-Postfix-Java

This is a simple Java program that converts an **infix expression** (like `A+(B*C)`) to its **postfix equivalent** using a stack data structure.

## üìå What is Infix and Postfix?

- **Infix Expression:** Operators are written between operands.  
  Example: `A + B`
  
- **Postfix Expression:** Operators are written after operands.  
  Example: `AB+`

### üß† How it works

The program:
- Reads an infix expression.
- Uses a stack to rearrange the expression according to operator precedence and parentheses.
- Outputs the postfix version of the expression.
